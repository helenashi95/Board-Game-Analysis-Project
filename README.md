# Board Game Analysis

In this project, we analyzed data from BoardGameGeek.com (https://www.kaggle.com/mrpantherson/board-game-data) to understand:

1. What features can we recommend our clients to produce the highest ratings in a new game?
2. If a user inputs certain characteristics, can we recommend a similar game for them to try? 

By running exploratory analysis using Net Promoter Score and implementing a multiple regression and decision tree model, we concluded that a board game maker should create longer, complex games, target audiences of at least 13 years, and conceptualize wargame centered games.

We also created an interactive bokeh app that allowed users to input preferred characteristics and view recommended games based on game rank.
