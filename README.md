# Board Game Analysis

In this project, we analyzed data from BoardGameGeek.com (https://www.kaggle.com/mrpantherson/board-game-data) to understand:

1. What features can we recommend our clients to produce the highest ratings in a new game?
2. If a user inputs certain characteristics, can we recommend a similar game for them to try? 

By running exploratory analysis using Net Promoter Score and implementing a multiple regression and decision tree model, we concluded that a board game maker should:

*Create longer, more complex games
*Target audiences of at least 13 years old
*Create concepts centered around wargames

We also created an interactive bokeh app that allowed users to input preferred characteristics and view recommended games based on game rank.
